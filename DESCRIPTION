Description: plot.data is an R package for creating client-ready data for various plots and visualizations. Data can be returned as either a data.table or a json file. The json file also includes some additional information helpful for rendering various plot widgets (ex: recommended range and step for a bin width slider to accompany a histogram). The `data.table`s are organized so that each row represents data for one group per panel. Optionally compute various statistics (ex: smoothed conditional mean, kernel density estimates, odds ratio, relative risk, etc).
